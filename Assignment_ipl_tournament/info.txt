Created 3 tables :
1. Venues(v_id pk, v_name)
2. Teams(t_id pk,t_name,captain)
3. Matchs(m_id pk,match_date, v_id fk, result,team_1 fk,team_2 fk)

create 3 tables to archive data redundancy. to fetch data from all these tables I created 3 foreign key in matchs table. Hence to fetch the data of any table we can join the table with a match table and select the values from the joined table.

Pros: Data redundancy is archivedÂ 

cons: The unique values of tables are considered so that team name and captain name are not repeated but the id is increasing whenever the program is running hence the auto-increment value is working on duplicate values as well.
